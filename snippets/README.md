#Common Code Snippets

These java files provide common code snippets that appear on [http://teachapcs.com/snippets](http://teachapcs.com/snippets)

##Contributing
Add a `.java` file to this folder. Put your code snippet, without a Main class or method, in the file, and use the file's filename to indicate the snippet's title.

Or, if you'd prefer to edit a snippet, just grab the appropriate `.java` file and change whatever you see fit.

##Order
Order is kept by the filename. (Suggestions welcome on better ways to do this!)
