#Strings and characters
Strings are made up of characters, or what Java calls <word data-key="char">char</word>s. A string's characters are numbered from left to right, starting with 0.

    String s = "My phone";
                01234567    

In the string `"My phone"`, the `M` is at index 0, the `y` at index 1, the ` ` at index 2, the `p` at index 3, etc:
<table class="table">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Character</strong></td>
            <td>M</td>
            <td>y</td>
            <td> </td>
            <td>p</td>
            <td>h</td>
            <td>o</td>
            <td>n</td>
            <td>e</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Index</strong></td>
            <td>0</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>4</td>
            <td>5</td>
            <td>6</td>
            <td>7</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
