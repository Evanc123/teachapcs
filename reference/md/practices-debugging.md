# Debugging
Debugging is the process of finding and fixing bugs, or errors, in a computer program.

Here's a few common bugs:

* Are the variables of the correct type? (Are you ever using <word data-key="int">ints</word> where <word data-key="double">doubles</word> would suit better?)
* Are your <word data-key="control">control statement</word> brackets matched accurately, with the right code inside the brackets? And no extra code inside the brackets?
* If your variables have default initial values, are those defaults correct?
* Can you explain all the lines in your program?
