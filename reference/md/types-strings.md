#Strings
A `String` is a piece of text in Java, and it gets its name from the way it "strings together" letters or numbers.

Strings are one of Java's main data types; unlike other data types, Strings are <word data-key="object">Objects</word>, not <word data-key="primitive">primitives</word>.

Strings are stored as sequences of <word data-key="char">characters</word>. For example:

    String name = "Hi!";

creates a new String called `name` made up of the characters `"H"`, `"i"`, and `"!"`
