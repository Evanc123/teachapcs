#Java
Java is a computer language that a now-defunct Silicon Valley company called Sun Microsystems first released in 1995. Like a spoken language, Java has its own vocabulary and syntax.

Java is based on English so, if you can read English, you can read Java. Its syntax rules are pickier though; it expects every statement to end with a `;` and all parens (`(` and `)`) and brackets (`{` and `}`) must match. Other computer languages aren't this demanding.

The programmers who wrote Java might say these strict rules make it easier to write legible word and spot errors. Other people think it's just tedious. We'll let you decide how you like Java's syntax rules.
