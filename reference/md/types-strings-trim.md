# Trimming strings
Getting rid of leading and trailing white space in a string is called "trimming." Trimming strings is often helpful when you work with input from a user of your program.

**Called on**: the string to be trimmed

**Arguments**: None

**Returns**: the string without beginning or trailing white space

## Example

    String trueSentence = " I have extra spaces! ";
    falseSentence = trueSentence.trim();             // "I have extra spaces!";
