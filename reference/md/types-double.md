#doubles
Java calls real numbers, like `3.1415`, `4440.31`, or `1.6e4`, `doubles`.

When you write doubles, you can use numbers, one decimal place, and scientific notation (like `1.6e4`) but can't use commas, percentages, dollar signs, hashmarks, or other non-numeric symbols.

Assigning a double to a variable works like this:

    double d = 49592.34;
    double e = -0.494;
    double f = d + e;
