<h1>Storing doubles</h1>

<p>The <word data-key="double">double</word> type is named after "double precision floating-point numbers," which is a format describing how the computer should store numbers in its memory.</p>

<p>When you assign a real number to a double variable, Java puts in <word data-key="byte">8 bytes'</word> worth of information. Everything else is dropped.</p>

<p>Though that sounds a little crazy – Java <em>cuts off</em> the number? – it's really that we've programmed computers to act like we do. </p>

<p>What's <code>1/3</code> as a decimal? <code>0.3333333 ...</code> right? Like humans, the computer ran out of space to track all those trailing 3s, so it cuts them off after 8 bytes, hoping that's precise enough for you.</p>
