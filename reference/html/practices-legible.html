<h1>Legibility</h1>

<p>A legible program is one whose meaning is clear when it's read by someone who didn't write it. (Or, soemtimes, by you; code has a nasty habit of turning into gibberish when it's left alone for a few hours.) The goal of a legible program is that people <em>and</em> computers can read it.</p>

<p>Using sensible variable and method names is one of the fastest ways to make your code more legible. Here's a few hints:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use verb phrases for methods that perform an action or change a variable, e.g. <code>convertTemperatureToCelsius</code></li>
<li>Use descriptive nouns for variables, e.g. <code>double dinnerTime</code> or <code>boolean isRaining</code> or <code>int playersAge</code>.</li>
<li>Java convention is writing variables with multiple words in camelCase: remove the spaces, lower case the first word, and capitalize the first letter of all the subsequent words.</li>
</ol>
