<h1>Debugging</h1>

<p>Debugging is the process of finding and fixing bugs, or errors, in a computer program.</p>

<p>Here's a few common bugs:</p>

<ul>
<li>Are the variables of the correct type? (Are you ever using <word data-key="int">ints</word> where <word data-key="double">doubles</word> would suit better?)</li>
<li>Are your <word data-key="control">control statement</word> brackets matched accurately, with the right code inside the brackets? And no extra code inside the brackets?</li>
<li>If your variables have default initial values, are those defaults correct?</li>
<li>Can you explain all the lines in your program?</li>
</ul>
