<h1>Operator shorthand</h1>

<p>Increment and decrement operators are two special assignment operators that are used to add and subtract 1 from a number. (Why do we care so much about adding and subtracting by 1? They're often used in loops, which we'll look at soon.)</p>

<p>First, increment operators. The following four statements are equivalent:</p>

<p>Increment and decrement operators â€“ assignment shortcuts
    n = n + 1;
    n += 1;
    ++n;
    n++;</p>

<p>The <word data-key="++">++</word> operator, like the others we've seen, returns a value: the value of <code>n</code>, incremented by 1. Take a look at this example:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java"><code>int n = 4;
n
4
n+= 2;
n
6
n++;
n
7
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, the following four statements are equivalent:
    n = n - 1;
    n -= 1;
    --n;
    n--;</p>

<p>Putting the <code>++</code> in front (e.g. <code>++n</code>) is called prefix notation, and putting it at the back (e.g. <code>n++</code>) is called postfix notation. <code>++</code> is an operator just like <code>+</code> and it changes the variable's value wherever it's placed. Try this:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java"><code>int x = 1;
int y = x++;
y;
1
x;
2

int x = 1;
int y = ++x;
y;
2
x;
2
</code></pre>

<p>At the end of each block, <code>x</code> is equal to <code>2</code>, but y is equal to either <code>1</code> or <code>2</code> depending on where the <code>++</code> operator was placed. In the first example, the second line says "give y the value of x, and then increment x" while the second line of the second example says "increment x and give y that new value."</p>
