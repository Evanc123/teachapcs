<h1>Conditional expressions</h1>

<p>Conditional expressions allow our code to do different things based on a prior result.</p>

<p>It's like the logic we use every day: "it's cold, so I'll put on a coat"; "if you're running late, text your friend"; "if you're hungry, eat something; otherwise, go outside." In programming, those are known as <word data-key="if-else">if-else statements</word>.</p>

<p>We also take repetitive actions. Some of those have an <word data-key="indeterminate">indeterminate</word> end, e.g. "while I'd like to walk, move the left foot, then the right foot, then the left foot .. ", while others have a pre-defined stopping point: "read 2 chapters of the book" or "drive straight for 6 blocks and then turn left."</p>

<p>In programming, the former are mimiced with <word data-key="while">while loops</word> and the latter with <word data-key="for">for loops</word>.</p>
