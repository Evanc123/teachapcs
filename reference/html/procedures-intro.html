<h1>Functions introduction</h1>

<p>Functions are ways to group several statements together. Grouping statements into methods could save you time when programming and make your program more <word data-key="legible">legible</word>.</p>

<p>Here's an example of a method. This one adds 2 to whatever it's passed:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java"><code>addsTwo(int initial){
    return initial + 2;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Like math, in programming, functions don't do anything on their own; they just sit there, waiting to be used.</p>

<p>Sometimes in computer science, people say "call a method" to mean "use a function." The two phrasings are equivalent. To call a method, simple write its name and pass it the necessary <word data-key="parameter">parameters</word>:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java"><code>addsTwo(5);         // returns 7
addsTwo(0);         // returns 2
addsTwo(-3);        // returns -1
</code></pre>

<p>Calling the <code>addsTwo</code> method made the computer jump into action and run our statement.</p>
