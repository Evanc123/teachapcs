<h1>while loops</h1>

<p>While loops ask the program to do something <em>while</em> something else is true. For example:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java"><code>int age = 15;
while(age &lt; 18){
    System.out.println("Age is " + age);
    age++;
}

"Age is 15"
"Age is 16"
"Age is 17"
</code></pre>

<p>Translated into English, we're saying that while <code>age</code> is less than 18:
1. Print a sentence that's "Age is " and then the value of the <code>age</code> variable
2. Increment age by 1. (Remember <code>age++</code> is the same as <code>age=age+1</code>)</p>

<p>More generally, they look like:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java"><code>while(&lt;expression is true&gt;){
    &lt;statement&gt;;
}
</code></pre>
