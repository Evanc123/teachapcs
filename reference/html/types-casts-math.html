<h1>Casts and division</h1>

<p><word data-key="casting">Casting</word> becomes more important when we're doing math problems because Java's got two ways of doing division:</p>

<ol>
<li>Floating point division</li>
<li>Integer division</li>
</ol>

<h2>Floating point division</h2>

<p>Floating point division is the division you know:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java"><code>3.0/4           // = 0.75
5/4.0           // = 1.25
1.0/4           // = 0.25
</code></pre>

<h2>Integer division</h2>

<p>Integer division is a special kind of division that computers can do. In integer division, all answers are integers (whole numbers), and any decimals are dropped.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java"><code>3/4           // = 0
5/4           // = 1
1/4           // = 0
</code></pre>

<h2>Using each</h2>

<p>Integer division happens when all the numbers being divided are integers. Floating point division's used when at least one number's a double.</p>

<p>You can also force floating point division with casts. Just keep in mind the order of operations!</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java"><code>(double) 3/4       // = 0.75
(double) 5/4       // = 1
(double) (1/4)     // = 0.0 because integer division came before the cast
</code></pre>
