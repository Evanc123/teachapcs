<h1>Nested for loops</h1>

<p>You can nest, or include, for loops inside of other for loops as well. For example:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java"><code>for(int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++){
    for(int j = 0; j &lt; 4; j++){
        System.out.println("i is " + i + " &amp; j is " + j);
    }
}

i is 0 and j is 0
i is 0 and j is 1
i is 0 and j is 2
i is 0 and j is 3
i is 1 and j is 0
i is 1 and j is 1
i is 1 and j is 2
i is 1 and j is 3
i is 2 and j is 0
i is 2 and j is 1
i is 2 and j is 2
i is 2 and j is 3
</code></pre>
