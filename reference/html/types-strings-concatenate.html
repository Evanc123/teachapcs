<h1>Concatenating strings</h1>

<p>Java uses <word data-key="+">+</word> to concatenate, or add, strings.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java"><code>String favorite = "Art History"
favorite = favorite + " is fun!";
favorite                                // "Art History is fun!"
</code></pre>

<p>As strings are <word data-key="immutable">immutable</word>, concatenation re-assigns the variable's reference rather than changing its value.</p>

<p>String concatenation works so long as all the item's you're assigning can be turned into strings:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java"><code>String sentence = "My favorite number is ";
int favNum = 3;
String sentence = sentence + favNum;
sentence;                                      // "My favorite number is 3"
</code></pre>
