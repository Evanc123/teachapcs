# TeachAPCS: a repository of material for AP Computer Science teachers

Tools, links, exercises, and reference materials from [TeachAPCS](http://teachapcs.com)

## Overview

- `/dictionary` houses data for the [Computer Science Dictionary](http://teachapcs.com/dictionary)
- `/errors` keeps track of common [Compiler Errors](http://teachapcs.com/errors) and their compilerish-to-English translations.
- `/exercises` collects files for the [Popular Exercises](http://teachapcs.com/exercises) series. Inside, you'll find html and md versions of all text, java starter files, and the yaml-powered glue to consolidate them.
- `/reference` is the [open-source introductory Java "textbook"](https://github.com/christinac/teachapcs) on the site.
- `/resources` catalogs external resources – links, videos, or textbook snippets – that could be good supplements to material learned elsewhere. These power the [Video Microlectures](http://teachapcs.com/microlectures) and the "other resources" section of the main reference.
