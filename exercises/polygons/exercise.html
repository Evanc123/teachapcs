<h2>Rectangle Class</h2>

<p>In addition to the public <word data-key="function">methods</word> from the <word data-key="interface">interface</word> that you will need to implement, you should also implement the following methods: </p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java"><code>public String toString(); // all well-written classes should override this 
                          // inherited method from Object 

// sample return strings:
// [(0,0) (0,5) (4,5) (4,0)] [Rectangle] [area = 20] [perimeter = 18] 
// [(0,0) (0,5) (5,5) (5,0)] [Square] [area = 25] [perimeter = 20] 

public boolean isRectangle(); 
public boolean isSquare(); 
public double diagonalLength(); // coordinates of vertices will have been 
                                // listed in consecutive order working 
                                // around the polygon – therefore, you’ll be able to easily find diagonal vertices
</code></pre>

<h2>Specs for the Triangle Class</h2>

<p>In addition to the public methods from the interface that you will need to implement, you should also implement the following methods: </p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java"><code>public String toString(); 
// sample return strings: 
// [(1,0) (1,4) (4,0)] [Isosceles Right] [area = 8] [perimeter = 14] 
// [(1,0) (1,4) (1,9)] [Not a Triangle] [area = none] [perimeter = none] 

/** 
 * Determine the type of triangle. 
 * @returns returns one of the following: Equilateral, Isosceles, Isosceles Right, Scalene, Right, Not a Triangle 
 */ 
public String triangleType(); 
public boolean isTriangle(); 
public boolean isEquilateral(); 
public boolean isIsosceles(); 
public boolean isRight(); 
public boolean isScalene();
</code></pre>

<p><em>Note</em>: All math for area/perimeter should be done with <word data-key="double">doubles</word> for an accurate result – however, you should round your answer before putting it into the <word data-key="string">String</word>. The format of the String you return for the <word data-key="to-string">toString()</word> and triangleType() methods must match the examples above EXACTLY.</p>
