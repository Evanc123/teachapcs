<p>A <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/cc-seventh-grade-math/cc-7th-probability-statistics/cc-7th-central-tendency/v/statistics-intro-mean-median-and-mode">mode</a> is a value in an <word data-key="array">array</word> that is larger than both the value immediately before it in the array and the value immediately after it. </p>

<p>In other words, a mode occurs at index k in the array A if A[k] > A[k-1] and A[k] > A[k+1]</p>

<p>The array is <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Unimodal.html">unimodal</a> if the value increase until they reach a mode, then decrease, so that there is only one mode. </p>

<p>For example, the array A shown below is unimodal with its mode occurring at index 4:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java"><code>Index k A[k]
0       3 
1       5 
2       9 
3       10 
4       12 
5       11 
6       9 
7       4
</code></pre>

<p>Assume that the mode does not occur at the first or last entry in the array.</p>
