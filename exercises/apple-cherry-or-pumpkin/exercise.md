1. First, edit the function <code>calculatePi</code> to use the [Leibniz formula for pi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz_formula_for_pi). The <word data-key="parameter">parameter</word> `int iterations` denotes how many terms we should add. Print the approximation after each iteration.
2. Next, approximate pi by cycling through the loop 7 times (that is, until the last addition is <code>4/13</code>). What do you get? <input class='form-control exercise-answer' id='applecherryorpumpkin-1' type='text'></input></p>
3. What's the difference in the approxiamtion you get from running the loop 20 times versus 10 time? *(You should only have to make one change to your program to calculate this!)* <p><input class='form-control exercise-answer' id='applecherryorpumpkin-2' type='text'></input></p>
