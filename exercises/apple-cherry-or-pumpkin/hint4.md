<word data-key="for">for loops</word> don't have to start at 0; they can start at whichever number you like, and go until whichever number you like.

Like other programming tools, for loops are around to help you think. So sometimes, you'll start your loop at 0 (say, for indices), and other times, you'll prefer starting at 1 (say, to keep track of how many times you've done something.)
