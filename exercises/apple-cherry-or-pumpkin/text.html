<p><a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Pi.html">pi</a> (π), the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, is often written as 3.141592653. The decimal doesn't repeat, but you can estimate it using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz_formula_for_pi">Leibniz formula for pi</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Alternate adding and subtracting fractions with a <word data-key="numerator">numerator</word> of 4 and a <word data-key="denominator">denominator</word> of the subsequent odd number, starting with 1:
<br/><br/></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <code>pi = (4/1) - (4/3) + (4/5) - (4/7) + (4/9) - (4/11) ...</code>

<p>The series is infinite - it goes on forever – and gets more precise with each additional term.</p>
