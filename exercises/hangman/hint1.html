<p>As a general rule, it's often easier to debug your program when it <em>isn't</em> choosing things randomly. That way, you can at least reproduce your errors so it's easier to think through fixing them.</p>

<p>The "random" part of Hangman is choosing a word from the list. Perhaps the first version of your program using the same word, so you won't have to guess which word you've chosen <em>and</em> debug at the same time. Once you've got things working for that first word, you could add on the feature of picking words from the list.</p>
