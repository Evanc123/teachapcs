<p>Write a program that plays the game <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman'>Hangman</a> with text only. At a high level, the game should work like this: </p>

<ol>
<li>A secret word is chosen at random from the list of words provided in the words.txt file. (Which you can edit, if you like; all you need to do is separate each work by a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline'>new line</a>.)</li>
<li>The program displays <code>_</code>s representing the letters of the word.
On each turn, the program asks the user for a letter, and the user submits a guess.</li>
<li>The game ends when either the user has uncovered each letter in the word or when the user has made 5 incorrect guesses.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here's one sequence of output when the user correctly guesses the word:</p>

<pre class='prettyprint'><code>Welcome to Hangman!<br />I've chosen a word for you. Here it is:<br />_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _<br />Which letter would you like to guess?
