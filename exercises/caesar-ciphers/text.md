During the [Gallic Wars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallic_Wars), Julius Caesar needed to pass messages to his commander Cicero. So he'd write a note and give it to his messenger – but sometimes, those notes were intercepted by his enemies, and his battle plans revealed.

Caesar needed to make sure his notes would stay secret, even if they fell into the wrong hands. So he started encoding them using what we now call a <word data-key="caesar-shift">Caesar shift</word>.

Caesar and Cicero would agree on a number – say, 3. Then, when Caesar wrote his notes, he'd replace each letter with the letter three places further down in the alphabet. So <code>ABC</code> would become <code>DEF</code> and <code>CAESAR</code> would become <code>FDHVDU</code>.

If the Gauls intercepted the messages, they'd see gibberish, but Cicero would know how to decode them. Pretty witty, eh?
