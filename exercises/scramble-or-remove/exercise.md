Write the `scrambleOrRemove` <word data-key="function">method</word>. It takes an <word data-key="arraylist">ArrayList</word>, and your code should:

1. Look through each entry in the ArrayList and scramble it using `scrambleWord`.
2. If the original and scrambled words are identical, remove that entry from the List. 
3. Otherwise, move on to the next item in the list.
