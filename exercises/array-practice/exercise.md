There's several methods you'll need to complete:


`int[] buildArray(int start, int finish)` which returns an array that contains the numbers from 'start' to 'finish', inclusive.
   
`void printArrayContents(String message, int[] array)` which prints the message that is passed in, as well as all the numbers in the array.

`void printSumAndAverage(int[] array)` which prints the SUM and the AVERAGE of the numbers in the array.
