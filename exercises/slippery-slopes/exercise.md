In the program, the points `(x1, x2)` and `(y1, y2)` are stored as four <word data-key="double">doubles</word> called `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, and `y2`.

On line 9, write the general equation for a slope, in terms of `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, and `y2`. Then, run the program and check out the slope you just calculated!
