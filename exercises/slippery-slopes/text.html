<p>Remember the function to find the <a href='http://coolmath.com/algebra/08-lines/06-finding-slope-line-given-two-points-01.htm'>slope of a line</a> given two points?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Divide the difference of the two y values (the rise) by the difference between the two x values (the run): (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let's write a program to calculate the slope of a line for us, if we give it two points.</p>
