<p>In the program, the points <code>(x1, x2)</code> and <code>(y1, y2)</code> are stored as four <word data-key="double">doubles</word> called <code>x1</code>, <code>x2</code>, <code>y1</code>, and <code>y2</code>.</p>

<p>On line 9, write the general equation for a slope, in terms of <code>x1</code>, <code>x2</code>, <code>y1</code>, and <code>y2</code>. Then, run the program and check out the slope you just calculated!</p>
