<p>Lets <word>extend</word> our basic chatterbot to create a chatterbot with different behavior.</p>

<p>Specifically, imagine a <code>MomBot</code>: something that acted like a <code>chatterbot</code> – it could say hello, goodbye, and push conversations forward – but it'd do all that in a more motherly way.</p>

<p>We'd probably want to use some of the chatterbot code we've already written to make a MomBot, since we've already got a few useful methods defined. Can we use them somehow without re-writing them?</p>
