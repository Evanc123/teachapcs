<p>There's several methods you'll need to complete:</p>

<p><code>String getUserChoice()</code> which returns the move that the user has played. The method should print out "Enter rock, paper, or scissors!" and then read in one word from the user.</p>

<p><code>String getComputerChoice()</code> which returns one of "rock", "paper", or "scissors" at random.</p>

<p><code>String computeWinner(String userChoice, String computerChoice)</code> which will accept as parameters the user's choice and the computer's choice and return either "Tie!","User Wins!", or "Computer Wins!", depending on who the winner is.</p>

<p><code>void main(String[] args)</code> which should:</p>

<ol>
<li>Welcome the user to the game: print something like "Welome to Rock Paper Scissor!"</li>
<li>Ask the user to enter a move to play</li>
<li>Get the random computer move, and print out who won</li>
<li>Ask if the user wants to quit (the user can enter 'exit' to stop playing), and if not, play again</li>
</ol>

<p>Also included is a <code>void testRockPaperScissors()</code> method so you can test your code.</p>
