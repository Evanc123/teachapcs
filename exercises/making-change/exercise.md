1. With a <word data-key="random">random number generator</word>, generate the amount of purchase, including where the dollars part is a random integer from 1 to 10 and where the cents part is a random real number from 0.0 to 0.99.
2. Prompts the user for the amount of cash tendered (read as a real number)
3. Calculates and prints out the coinage necessary to make correct change. You should also echo the original data entered back to the user and report the number of whole dollars needed for change as well. You can assume that there will always be some coins returned
4. You should format the output in some nice manner.
5. You should correctly print singular versus plural endings (i.e., quarter/quarters). Use an <word data-key="if-else">“if” statement</word> – this is the ONLY time you are allowed to use an if statement in this lab.
6. You must print the $ before the dollar amount and the ¢ after the cents.
