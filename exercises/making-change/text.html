<p>Some cash register systems use automatic change machines where the coinage is automatically dispensed. This lab will investigate the problem solving and programming behind such machinery. </p>

<p>You should use integer mathematics to solve this problem. You will need to extract the amount of cents from dollar amounts expressed in real numbers. </p>

<p>This will require using the <word data-key="casting">type cast operator</word> and dealing with the approximate nature of real number storage. </p>

<p>Here is an example:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java"><code>double purchaseAmount, cashPaid, temp;
int change;
... data input stuff
temp = cashPaid - purchaseAmount;
temp = temp â€“ (int) (temp);
change = (int) (temp * 100);

// Example Values (as done in a math class):
// 8.06 = 30.00 - 21.94 
// 0.06 = 8.06 - 8
// 6 = (int) (0.06 * 100)
</code></pre>

<p>However, when the above example was run on a computer, the answer of 5 was given. Because real numbers are stored as approximations, the value of <code>change</code> comes out incorrect. You must investigate why and solve the problem.</p>

<p>You should solve this part of the problem <strong>FIRST</strong>, before you go on and calculate the correct number of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.</p>
