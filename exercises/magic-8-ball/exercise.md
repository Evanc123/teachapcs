Below is the start of a Magic 8 Ball program, though it doesn't work yet.

Change it by:

1. Ask the Magic8Ball a question by storing a <word data-key="string">string</word> in the `question` <word data-key="variable">variable.</word>
2. Adding at least five answers your 8 Ball could give to the `String[] answers`. Remember to format each as a string. If you'd like your Magic 8 ball to have more than five potential answers, just increase the <word data-key="array-size">array's size</word>.
2. Pull out a <word data-key="random">random</word> String from `String[] answers` to be the Magic 8 Ball's answer.
3. <word data-key="print">Print</word> the randomly-chosen answer.

Happy fortune telling!
