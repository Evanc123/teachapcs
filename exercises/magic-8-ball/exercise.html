<p>Below is the start of a Magic 8 Ball program, though it doesn't work yet.</p>

<p>Change it by:</p>

<ol>
<li>Ask the Magic8Ball a question by storing a <word data-key="string">string</word> in the <code>question</code> <word data-key="variable">variable.</word></li>
<li>Adding at least five answers your 8 Ball could give to the <code>String[] answers</code>. Remember to format each as a string. If you'd like your Magic 8 ball to have more than five potential answers, just increase the <word data-key="array-size">array's size</word>.</li>
<li>Pull out a <word data-key="random">random</word> String from <code>String[] answers</code> to be the Magic 8 Ball's answer.</li>
<li><word data-key="print">Print</word> the randomly-chosen answer.</li>
</ol>

<p>Happy fortune telling!</p>
