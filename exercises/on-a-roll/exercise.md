The `Dice` <word data-key="class">class</word> has two methods:

1. `getRolls(int)`, which should return an <word data-key="int-array">int array</word> of dice-toss results that's `numRolls` long. You'd use this to get and store several dice rolls in one array.
2. `roll()`, which returns the outcome of one dice roll – a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. It's already written and works.

Write the `getRolls(int)` code.
