<p>The <code>Dice</code> <word data-key="class">class</word> has two methods:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>getRolls(int)</code>, which should return an <word data-key="int-array">int array</word> of dice-toss results that's <code>numRolls</code> long. You'd use this to get and store several dice rolls in one array.</li>
<li><code>roll()</code>, which returns the outcome of one dice roll – a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. It's already written and works.</li>
</ol>

<p>Write the <code>getRolls(int)</code> code.</p>
