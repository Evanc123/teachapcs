Here's another example output that gives more detail about how the calculations happen:
<pre><code>
Where to start? <span style='color:red;'>15</span></br>
15 is odd, so take 3x + 1: 46<br />
46 is even, so take half: 23<br />
23 is odd, so take 3x + 1: 70<br />
70 is even, so take half: 35<br />
35 is odd, so take 3x + 1: 106<br />
106 is even, so take half: 53<br />
53 is odd, so take 3x + 1: 160<br />
160 is even, so take half: 80<br />
80 is even, so take half: 40<br />
40 is even, so take half: 20<br />
20 is even, so take half: 10<br />
10 is even, so take half: 5<br />
5 is odd, so take 3x + 1: 16<br />
16 is even, so take half: 8<br />
8 is even, so take half: 4<br />
4 is even, so take half: 2<br />
2 is even, so take half: 1<br />
The process took 17 to reach 1
