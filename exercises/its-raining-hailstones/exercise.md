Here's the run-down:

1. Start with a whole number <code>x</code>.
2. While <code>x</code> isn't 1 do the following:
    a. If <code>x</code> is even, divide it by 2.
    b. If <code>x</code> is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
    c. Print `x`.
3. Repeat step 2 until `x` is 1.

Though it appears <code>x</code> will <em>always</em> equal 1 eventually, no one has yet figured out why.
