<p>Here's the run-down:</p>

<ol>
<li>Start with a whole number <code>x</code>.</li>
<li>While <code>x</code> isn't 1 do the following:
a. If <code>x</code> is even, divide it by 2.
b. If <code>x</code> is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
c. Print <code>x</code>.</li>
<li>Repeat step 2 until <code>x</code> is 1.</li>
</ol>

<p>Though it appears <code>x</code> will <em>always</em> equal 1 eventually, no one has yet figured out why.</p>
