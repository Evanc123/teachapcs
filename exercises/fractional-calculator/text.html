<p>Implement a basic calculator that handles fractions.</p>

<p>The program should read in fraction equations and print the results in a continuous loop until the user types "quit"</p>

<p>Input will be either mixed fractions, proper fractions, improper fractions or integers</p>

<p>Input will be separated by spaces – exactly one space between each fraction and operator.</p>

<p>The integer and fraction parts of a mixed fraction will be separated by an underscore.</p>

<p>Negatives are allowed – the negative sign should go immediately before the whole part of the number (with no space in between)</p>

<p>The operators will be +, -, *, and /</p>

<p>The output needs to be in standard mixed fractions, properly reduced (i.e. 1/2 instead of 2/4, 1_1/4 instead of 5/4)</p>
