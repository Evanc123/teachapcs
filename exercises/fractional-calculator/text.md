Implement a basic calculator that handles fractions.

The program should read in fraction equations and print the results in a continuous loop until the user types "quit"

Input will be either mixed fractions, proper fractions, improper fractions or integers

Input will be separated by spaces – exactly one space between each fraction and operator.

The integer and fraction parts of a mixed fraction will be separated by an underscore.

Negatives are allowed – the negative sign should go immediately before the whole part of the number (with no space in between)

The operators will be +, -, *, and /

The output needs to be in standard mixed fractions, properly reduced (i.e. 1/2 instead of 2/4, 1_1/4 instead of 5/4)
