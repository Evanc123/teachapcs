<ol>
<li>Write a <word data-key="function">method</word> that starts with an array <code>A = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]</code> and computes an array <code>B</code> that holds the squares of the elements in array A (so <code>B = [4, 16, .. ]</code>.)</li>
<li>Write a method that starts with an array <code>A = [-2, 12, 0, 34, 43]</code> and an array B that holds values such that the sum of indexed elements is 25.  Your program should compute these values and place them in <code>B</code>.</li>
<li>Write a method that uses three arrays, <code>A = [-1, 5, 0, 31, 12]</code>; <code>B = [0, 2, -4, 21, 4]</code>; and <code>C</code> such that <code>C</code> holds the difference between indexed elements of A and B.  Your program should calculate these values and place them in <code>C</code>.</li>
