<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> is a new cryptocurrency. It's based on <code>transactions</code>, which are records that record a payment between two parties, and a <code>ledger</code>, which is a list of every payment that's been made.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is similar to cash in that once a bitcoin's been transfered, and the entry is made in the ledger, it can't be reversed or changed: the record will stay there.</p>

<p>We actually know enough Java to implement bitcoin â€“ so let's get to it.</p>
