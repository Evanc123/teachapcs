<p>You're given an outline of two classes: <code>Transaction</code>, which stores records in the blockchain, and <code>Ledger</code>, which maintains a list of all the transactions that have occured.</p>

<p>Neither class is quite finished yet; it's up to you to do that. Specifically:</p>

<ol>
<li>Implement the Transaction <word>constructor</word> and <word>getter</word>, <word>toString</word>, and <word>compareTo</word> methods.</li>
<li>Implement the <code>verify</code> and <code>add</code> methods of the <code>Ledger</code> class.</li>
<li>Bitcoin doesn't allow anyone to remove transactions from the list; you can only add on to the end of it. What can you do to make sure the only way to change the <code>ledger</code> is with the methods you provide?</li>
<li>Finally: in the starter code, <code>Transaction</code> <word>implements</word> Comparable. Why was that useful?</li>
</ol>
