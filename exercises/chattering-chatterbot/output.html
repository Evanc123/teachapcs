<p>The precise implementation is up to you, but as one example, running this script: 

<pre><code>
Chatterbot chatters = new Chatterbot();
chatters.sayHello();
String response = chatters.waitForResponse();
while(response){
	chatters.continueConversation();
	if(response.equals("Goodbye!"){
		chatters.sayGoodbye();
		break;
	}
}
</code></pre>

should produce something like this, where the chatterbot is in black and the user is in <span style="color:blue;">blue</span>.</p>

<pre><code>"Hi there!"
<span style="color:blue;">"Hi!"</span>
"Is that so?"
<span style="color:blue;">"Er, I think so?"</span>
"Really?"
<span style="color:blue;">"Yes! I just said hello!"</span>
"You wouldn't say?"
<span style="color:blue;">"Hrmph."</span>
"I had no idea."
<span style="color:blue;">"Goodbye"</span>
"Bye!"
</code></pre>

<p>(No need to follow this Chatterbot exactly; give yours its own speaking style!)</p>
