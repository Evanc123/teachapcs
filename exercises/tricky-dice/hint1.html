<p>One way to make a dice "tricky" is to have it show lower numbers more often than it would normally. A few ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li>Every other time you roll a 6, turn it into a 3</li>
<li>If you roll a number greater than 3, subtract 3 from it</li>
<li>Divide your roll by 2 or 3, and return that number</li>
<li><word data-key="%">Mod</word> your roll by 3 or 4 and return that</li>
<li>Use two <word data-key="random-int">random numbers</word> to decide what you should return</li>
</ul>
