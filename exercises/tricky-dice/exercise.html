<p>Below is a simple script that uses Java's built in <word data-key="random">random number generator</word> to make a dice. Specifically, it:</p>

<ol>
<li>Creates a new Random number generator, and saves it in a variable called <code>gen</code>.</li>
<li>Asks <code>gen</code> to give its next integer in the range [0, 6). Then, we add 1 to what the <code>nextInt</code> function returns, because we want our dice to give back 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.</li>
</ol>

<p>That makes a normal dice from code.</p>

<p>Let's make a tricky dice instead. It's up to you how to do this, but there's a few rules (even for tricky die):</p>

<ol>
<li>A dice is "tricky" when the likelihood of it giving back a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 isn't equivalent – as in, it'll give back a 6 more than 18.33% of the time (on average.)</li>
<li>Your dice can only give back 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 – we want this to <em>seem</em> like a valid dice at first.</li>
<li>Which numbers your dice over-emphasizes, and which it understates, is entirely up to you.``</li>
</ol>
