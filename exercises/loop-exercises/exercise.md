Write loops that print: 

1. Even numbers between 22 and 48.
2. Multiples of 5 less than or equal to 85.
3. Powers of 2 from 0 to 10. (Don't forget that one way to think about powers is as repeated multiplication.)
4. The numbers 1 to 20, then back down to 1. 
5. A Tic-Tac-Toe board, where each square is a 3x3 grid.  Number each square, placing the value in the center of the grid.
