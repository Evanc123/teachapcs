<p>It can be hard to <word data-key="debug">debug</word> a program that has something random because you can't tell if the output is changing because of a bug or because of the randomness.</p>

<p>One tactic is making your program <em>not</em> random temporarily. Just replace the random part with a fixed number and a <word data-key="comment">comment</word>, like this:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java"><code>int temperature = 85; // getTemperature();
</code></pre>

<p>Once you think you have the program working without the randomness, add it back in.</p>
