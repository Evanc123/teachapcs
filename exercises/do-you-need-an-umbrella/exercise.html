<p>Let's finish off the Forecaster <word data-key="class">class</word>. Given a temperature and rain prediction, our forecaster should <word data-key="print">print</word> statements about the weather: something like "Woah, looks like rain! Better bring an umbrella!" or "Ooh, it'll be a hot one! Don't forget those shades." (Or whatever you like.)</p>

<p>How does the forecaster know what the weather? It asks the Meteorologist! Notice there's a Meteorologist <word data-key="class">class</word>, too. It works fine on its own, or you can edit it if you like.</p>

<p>Once you get things working, run your program a few times to get a sense for how the forecast changes from day to day (or from program run to program run.)</p>
