The one-­player version will replace one of the player paddles with a black wall from top to bottom. The wall will cause the ball to bounce back to the player. Since the wall “can’t miss,” the score will be the number of times the player successfully hits the ball back to the wall. When the player misses the first time, the game is over.

Your job is to design and write a Scratch program to create a one­player version of the 80s video game Pong. You can see what it looks like [here](http://www.ponggame.org/more­pong.php)

**Design strategies:**

  * Top­down design: This approach is when a project is broken down into smaller pieces
so that each piece performs only one function
  * Bottom­up design: This approach is when several already­completed systems are
integrated together to form a bigger system.
  * Most software design is done using the top­down design approach.
