<p>An old piece of math is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem">Pythagorean Theorem</a>, which relates the lengths of the three sides of a right triangle: the sum of the two leg lengths, squared, is equivalent to the hypotenuse's length, squared: <code>a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup></code>.</p>

<p>So if you know the length of each of the triangle's legs (<code>a</code>, <code>b</code>), the hypoteneus' length, <code>c</code>, is <code>square root[a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup>]</code></p>
