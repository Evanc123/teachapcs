<p>In order for my cards to work with your cards, they've got to be the same <em>type</em> of cards. How do we pull that off? With an <word data-key="interface">interface</word>, which is a simple way for students to use an object – in this case, a card – without needing to know how it's implemented or works.</p>

<p>The iCard interface specifies the behavior of the card without providing information about how cards are implemented:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java"><code>public interface ICard extends Comparable{
    public static final int SPADES = 0;
    public static final int HEARTS = 1;
    public static final int DIAMONDS = 2;
    public static final int CLUBS = 3;

    // returns a value like ICard.SPADES
    public int getSuit();

    // returns a value between 1 (ace) and 13 (king)
    public int getRank();
}
</code></pre>

<p>The ICard interface specifies the behavior of cards without providing information about their implementation. That's enough for us to do things with them like, for example, tell us if a list of cards is sorted:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java"><code>public boolean isSorted(ICard[] deck){
    for(int i = 1; i &lt; deck.length; i++){
        if(deck[i - 1].compareTo(deck[k]) &gt; 0){
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
</code></pre>
