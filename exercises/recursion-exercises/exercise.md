Write methods that print:

1. Numbers from `int n` down to 0 on new lines
2. Each letter of `String s` on a new line in reverse order
3. The sum of al positive integers less than or equal to `int n`
4. The average of the elements in `int[] nums`. (`int index` will help you keep track of your position in the array.)
