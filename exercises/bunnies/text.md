Imagine this: last January 1, you went for a walk and found a pair of magic bunnies. You decided to take them home.

On the bunnies' two-month birthday, they gave birth to another pair of magic bunnies. Then, every month after, each bunny pair bore another pair.

By the end of the year – 12 months later – how many pairs of bunnies will you have?
