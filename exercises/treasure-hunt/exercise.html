<p>Use a <word data-key="array">2d array</word> to represent a 10 x 10 grid of boxes. Your program should <word data-key="random">randomly</word> place a "prize" into four of the boxes.</p>

<p>The computer then guesses boxes until it finds all the prizes. A few other constraints:
- The program cannot place more than one prize in a box.
- The computer cannot make a guess it has already made.
- Track the number of guesses needed to find all the prizes.
- Display the number of guesses needed to find each box when it has been found</p>

<p>Once all the boxes have been found, also display the total number of guesses needed.</p>

<p>Oh, yeahâ€”you have to redraw the grid after each guess.  Be sure to separate the "iterations" from each other in such a way that the user won't be confused.</p>
