<p><strong>Game description</strong>: In this project you and your team will create a video game called Land Mine!</p>

<p>Here’s how the game works:</p>

<ol>
<li>The Board is arranged in an 8x8 grid (like a checkerboard).</li>
<li>The 8x8 board will create 64 individual cells</li>
<li>Each cell will either be empty, or contain a landmine that will explode when the cell is uncovered.</li>
<li>There should be 10 landmines placed randomly on the board (see note below about random numbers)</li>
<li>The player uncovers one cell at a time.
a. If the cell is empty, the player receives one point￼
￼ b. If the cell contains a landmine, the player explodes and loses one life</li>
<li>When the player loses 3 lives, the game is over</li>
<li>The game should have a leaderboard that is displayed between games
a. If a player gets a high score, the game should ask for his or her name which will be displayed on the leaderboard.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Group planning and discussion</strong>: Before you write a single line of code, you need to get together as a group and decide on the methods and instance data that will be required by the Model, View, and Controller classes.</p>

<p>For instance, the Model class will need a method called (for example) clearBoardwhich will set all the cells in the array to false. You will also need a method called randomizeMines(number)which will randomly place some number of mines on the board.</p>

<p>You'll also need to agree on the messaging protocol that will be used to communicate in the MVC framework. For instance, the View could send the message exposeCellwith a message payload of the cell number as so that the Controller could tell the Model to modify the app's data accordingly.</p>

<p><strong>Division of effort</strong>: Each team will consist of three people with the following responsibilities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Team member 1 will be in charge of writing and unit testing the Controller class</li>
<li>Team member 2 will be in charge of writing and unit testing the View class</li>
<li>Team member 3 will be in charge of writing and unit testing the Model class</li>
<li>All team members are responsible for integration testing (putting the classes together and testing the final game)</li>
<li>What the game’s UI looks like is up to you. Use your team’s gaming experience to guide you. Be creative and use your imagination.</li>
</ul>
