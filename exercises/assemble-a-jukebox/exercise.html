<p>We'll give you a <a href='assemble-a-jukebox/Song'>Song</a> class, which takes care of constructing new songs, and <a href='assemble-a-jukebox/JukeboxController'>JukeboxController</a> class, which has everything you need to <word>instantiate</word> a Jukebox object and tell it to do things by calling its methods. If you want to edit this code, you can, but you don't need to.</p>

<p>Your job is to assemble the jukebox by filling out the <a href='assemble-a-jukebox/Jukebox'>Jukebox</a> skeleton. By the time you're done, you'll have Jukebox that plays songs at your command!</p>
