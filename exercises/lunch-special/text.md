Congratulations: you've just been hired to help a deli sort out its online ordering system! 

The deli has three types of menu items:

- Sandwiches (like a Hamburger or a Chicken Salad Sandwich)
- Soups (like Potato Soup or Tomato Soup)
- Drinks (like a Coke or a coffee)

Here's the menu: 
<table class='table table-striped'><thead><tr><td>Sandwich</td><td>Soup</td><td>Drink</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Hamburger<br/><small>$6.50</small></td><td>Potato<br/><small>$1.75</small></td><td>Coffee<br/><small>$2.00</small></td></tr><tr><td>Chicken salad<br/><small>$5.50</small></td><td>Tomato<br/><small>$3.50</small></td><td>Coke<br/><small>$3.00</small></td></tr></tbody></table>

The deli's owners would like to add a lunch special to the menu, which is 1 sandwich, 1 soup, and 1 drink, for the combined price of the two highest-priced items in the set.

So a lunch special of a hamburger ($6.50), tomato soup ($4.50), and Coke ($2) would cost $11.
