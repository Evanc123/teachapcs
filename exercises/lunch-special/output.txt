If we made the `LunchSpecial` mentioned above, it should have the name "Hamburger/Tomato Soup/Coke" and cost $11.

// Assume chosenSandwich is a Sandwich object representing a hamburger, chosenSoup is Soup object representing tomato, and chosenDrink is a Drink object representing a Coke.
    
    LunchSpecial special = new LunchSpecial(chosenSandwich, chosenSoup, chosenDrink);
    special.getPrice();
    // returns 11.00
    special.getName();
    // returns "Hamburger/Tomato Soup/Coke"
